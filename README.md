# Connect Four AI

This is a artificial intelligence for the game Connect Four. It is written in JavaScript and there are frontends for the web browser and for the CLI.

## Requirements

- NodeJS 12.14.0 (or, if you use Docker, run `devenv.sh` to start a container)
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies

## Get started

- `web.sh` starts a web server on `localhost:8080` that serves the web frontend
- `repl.sh` runs the game on the command line
- `test.sh` to execute all tests (`-w` for watch mode)
- `dist.sh` creates the distributables in `./dist`
